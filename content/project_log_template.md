## üìù Template Usage Guide

**For Best AI Content Generation:**

1. **Be Specific**: Use exact numbers, timeframes, and technical details
2. **Show Impact**: Include before/after comparisons and measurable outcomes
3. **Tell Stories**: Each problem should have a clear narrative arc
4. **Include Emotions**: Mention excitement, frustration, satisfaction, or surprise
5. **Add Context**: Explain why decisions were made and what alternatives were considered
6. **Use Active Voice**: "Built," "Implemented," "Discovered," "Solved"
7. **Vary Content Types**: Mix technical details, business impact, and personal insights

**Content That Works Well for Each Tone:**
- **üß© Behind-the-Build**: Technical implementation details, architecture decisions, development process
- **üí° What Broke**: Problem sections, debugging stories, lessons learned from failures
