### 2025-01-16 - Follow-up Classification Loss Bug Fix
**Project:** AI Facebook Content Generator - Bug Fix Phase 2
**Tags:** #bugfix #testing #telegram #context-preservation #follow-up-posts
**Difficulty:** 3/5 | **Content Potential:** 4/5
**Details:** [content/dev_journal/fix-follow-up-classification_2025-01-16.md](content/dev_journal/fix-follow-up-classification_2025-01-16.md)

**Impact:** Fixed critical bug where regenerating follow-up posts caused them to lose their relationship context and be treated as original posts. Modified both `_regenerate_post()` and `_regenerate_with_tone()` functions to extract and preserve relationship metadata from `current_draft`.

**Key Innovation:** Test-driven development approach that identified the missing link between existing context data and AI generator parameters. The fix extracts `relationship_type` and `parent_post_id` from `current_draft` and passes them to regeneration calls.

**Technical Achievement:** 46/46 existing tests still pass, proving zero regression. Follow-up posts now maintain series continuity across regeneration cycles, preserving relationship types like "Series Continuation" and "Different Aspects".

**Related:** Bug Fixes, Context Preservation, Series Management, Test-Driven Development

### 2025-01-16 - Backslash Accumulation Bug Fix
**Project:** AI Facebook Content Generator - Bug Fix Phase 1
**Tags:** #bugfix #testing #telegram #user-experience
**Difficulty:** 3/5 | **Content Potential:** 4/5
**Details:** [content/dev_journal/fix-backslash-accumulation_2025-01-16.md](content/dev_journal/fix-backslash-accumulation_2025-01-16.md)

**Impact:** Fixed critical bug where backslashes accumulated exponentially in regenerated posts, making them unreadable. Implemented idempotent `_escape_markdown()` function that prevents multiple escaping of the same content.

**Key Innovation:** Test-driven development approach with comprehensive edge case testing. The fix uses a simple "check before escaping" strategy that maintains functionality while preventing accumulation.

**Technical Achievement:** All 6 new tests pass, 38 existing tests still pass, zero regression. Users can now regenerate posts without formatting degradation.

**Related:** Bug Fixes, Code Quality, User Experience Enhancement, Test-Driven Development
