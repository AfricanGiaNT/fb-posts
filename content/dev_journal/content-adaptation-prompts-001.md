## What I Built
I implemented the content adaptation prompts as specified in Phase 4 of the project plan. This involved updating the `ai_content_generator.py` to use a specific prompt when the target audience is "Business Owner/General".

The key change was modifying the `_get_business_audience_instructions` method to provide clear guidelines to the AI on how to generate content for a non-technical audience.

## The Challenge
The main challenge was ensuring the prompt was clear and comprehensive enough for the AI to understand the nuances of a business-focused tone. The existing implementation was already quite good, so the task was more about aligning it with the simplified plan rather than starting from scratch.

## My Solution
I replaced the existing business audience instructions with the new prompt from the `phase_4_simplified_plan.md`. The new prompt focuses on using simple language, emphasizing business impact (time/money saved), and using relatable examples.

```python
def _get_business_audience_instructions(self) -> str:
    """Get specific instructions for business audience."""
    return """
AUDIENCE: Business Owner/General (like busy shop owners, service providers)

Content Guidelines:
- Use simple, clear language
- Focus on business impact: time saved, money made, problems solved
- Use relatable examples (running a shop, managing customers, handling inventory)
- Avoid technical jargon - explain in everyday terms
- Emphasize practical benefits and real-world results
- Make it sound like you're talking to a friend who owns a business

Examples of good language:
- "This saves me 3 hours every week"
- "My customers are happier because..."
- "I used to spend all day on paperwork, now..."
- "It's like having an assistant that never sleeps"
"""
```

I kept the existing `_get_technical_audience_instructions` as per the plan, which stated that the technical mode should retain its current behavior.

## Impact and Lessons Learned
This change directly addresses a key requirement of Phase 4: making content generation more accessible to business owners. By tailoring the AI's instructions, the generated content should now resonate better with the "Nthambi the hustla" persona.

A key lesson was that sometimes a project's existing codebase is further ahead than the planning documents. It's important to review the current state before implementing, as it can save time and effort. In this case, I was able to leverage and refine existing work.
