# Fix Personal Perspective and Text Cutoff Issues

## What I Built
I implemented critical fixes to the AI content generation system to address two major issues: the AI was framing projects as being built "for farmers" instead of personal projects, and generated content was being cut off due to token limitations.

## The Problem
**Personal Perspective Crisis**: The AI was consistently generating content that framed projects as services built for others (e.g., "I built this for farmers in Malawi") instead of personal projects built to solve my own problems. This completely misrepresented the nature of the work as personal development projects.

**Text Cutoff Issue**: Generated Facebook posts were being truncated mid-sentence, with content ending abruptly like "The best part? It speaks in plain languag..." and "The post maintains enthusiasm while focusing on practical benefits that b...". This was due to insufficient token limits in the content generation.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **Missing Personal Perspective Instructions**: The system prompts had no explicit guidance about these being personal projects
2. **Token Limitations**: 2500 max_tokens was insufficient for 400-600 word posts
3. **Ambiguous Language**: The business audience instructions could be interpreted as building services for others

## My Solution
I implemented comprehensive fixes across all system prompts and generation parameters:

### 1. **Personal Perspective Enforcement**
Added explicit personal project perspective instructions to all system prompts:

```python
**CRITICAL PERSONAL PROJECT PERSPECTIVE:**
These are PERSONAL projects that I built to solve MY OWN problems. I am sharing my journey of building tools for myself, not creating services for others.

✅ CORRECT PERSPECTIVE:
- "I built this tool to solve my own problem with..."
- "I needed a way to handle my own..."
- "This helps me manage my own..."
- "I created this for my own use because..."

❌ INCORRECT PERSPECTIVE:
- "I built this for farmers to..."
- "This helps farmers with..."
- "Farmers can now..."
- "This system serves farmers by..."
```

### 2. **Token Limit Optimization**
Increased the max_tokens parameter from 2500 to 4000 to ensure full content generation:

```python
# Before
generated_content = self._generate_content(
    system_prompt, full_prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=2500
)

# After
generated_content = self._generate_content(
    system_prompt, full_prompt, temperature=0.7, max_tokens=4000
)
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Prompt Updates**
Updated all system prompts across the codebase:
- `_get_business_system_prompt()` - Business audience prompt
- `_get_base_system_prompt()` - Base system prompt
- `rules/ai_prompt_structure.mdc` - Master prompt template
- `rules/content_creation_guidelines.md` - Content guidelines

### 4. **Enhanced Voice Enforcement**
Strengthened the first-person language requirements:

```python
This is YOUR personal project that YOU built for YOURSELF. Share it authentically in first person without time frames.
```

## The Impact / Result
- **Perspective Correction**: AI now correctly frames projects as personal problem-solving tools
- **Complete Content**: No more text cutoff issues with 4000 token limit
- **Consistent Voice**: All generated content uses proper first-person perspective
- **Authentic Narrative**: Posts now reflect the true nature of personal development projects

## Key Lessons Learned
**Lesson 1: Explicit Instructions Matter**: The AI needs very clear, explicit instructions about perspective and ownership. Subtle hints aren't enough.

**Lesson 2: Token Limits Affect Quality**: Insufficient token limits can cause content truncation that makes posts unusable.

**Lesson 3: Comprehensive Updates Required**: Fixing perspective issues requires updating all prompt sources, not just one file.

**Lesson 4: Test with Real Content**: The issues only became apparent when testing with actual agricultural content that could be misinterpreted.

## How It Works: The Technical Details
The fixes were implemented across multiple layers:

**System Prompt Layer**:
- Added personal perspective section to all prompts
- Enhanced voice enforcement with specific examples
- Updated language to emphasize "for myself" vs "for others"

**Generation Parameters**:
- Increased max_tokens from 2500 to 4000
- Maintained temperature=0.7 for creativity balance
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing functionality

**Content Guidelines**:
- Updated markdown content guidelines
- Enhanced AI prompt structure documentation
- Added explicit examples of correct vs incorrect framing

The system now correctly interprets agricultural projects as personal farming tools rather than services for farmers, and generates complete content without truncation.
