# Project Structure Organization: Implementation Status Tracking

## What I Built
I organized the project structure by creating two new folders to better track implementation status:
1. **`to-be-implemented/`** - Contains features and enhancements planned for future implementation
2. **`implemented/`** - Will contain documentation for completed features and enhancements

## The Problem
The project had important planning and enhancement documents mixed in with active development content, making it difficult to:
- Track what features are planned vs. implemented
- Prioritize development work
- Maintain clear project roadmap visibility
- Separate active development from planning documents

## My Solution
I created a clear organizational structure to separate planning from implementation:

### New Folder Structure
```
fb-posts/
├── to-be-implemented/           # Future features and enhancements
│   ├── project-enhancement-roadmap.md
│   └── system-test.mdc
├── implemented/                 # Completed features documentation
│   └── [future completed features]
└── content/                    # Active development content
    ├── dev_journal/           # Development milestones
    ├── generated_drafts/      # AI-generated content
    └── markdown_logs/         # Input files
```

### Files Moved
- **`project-enhancement-roadmap.md`** → `to-be-implemented/`
  - Comprehensive roadmap of future enhancements
  - Feature prioritization matrix
  - Implementation timeline guidance
  
- **`system-test.mdc`** → `to-be-implemented/`
  - System testing strategies
  - Test automation plans
  - Quality assurance procedures

## Technical Implementation
```bash
# Created new organizational folders
mkdir -p to-be-implemented implemented

# Moved planning documents to appropriate folder
mv content/project-enhancement-roadmap.md to-be-implemented/
mv content/system-test.mdc to-be-implemented/
```

## The Results
The project now has clear separation between:
- **Active Development**: `content/dev_journal/` - Current development milestones
- **Future Planning**: `to-be-implemented/` - Features and enhancements to be built
- **Completed Features**: `implemented/` - Documentation for finished features

### Benefits
1. **Clear Development Focus**: Active development stays in `content/dev_journal/`
2. **Feature Tracking**: Easy to see what's planned vs. implemented
3. **Better Prioritization**: Planning documents are organized separately
4. **Cleaner Content Directory**: Removes planning documents from active development space
5. **Implementation Workflow**: Clear path from `to-be-implemented/` → `implemented/`

## Impact
This organization provides a foundation for better project management and feature tracking. As features from the roadmap are completed, their documentation can be moved from `to-be-implemented/` to `implemented/`, creating a clear development history.

The structure supports the project's evolution from a simple markdown-to-Facebook-post converter into a comprehensive content ecosystem as outlined in the enhancement roadmap.

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Organization Enables Focus**: Clear separation between planning and active development reduces cognitive load
2. **Implementation Status Matters**: Tracking what's planned vs. completed helps prioritize work
3. **Document Movement Shows Progress**: Moving files from `to-be-implemented/` to `implemented/` provides visual progress tracking
4. **Structure Supports Scale**: As the project grows, having clear organizational principles becomes more important
