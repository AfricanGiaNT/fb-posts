## What I Did
I performed the final "Integration & Testing" task for Week 2 of the Phase 4 plan. The goal was to ensure that the two main features developed this week—Chichewa Humor Integration and Content Continuation—work together correctly in a single, cohesive workflow.

## The Process
1.  **Enabled Combined Functionality**: I first updated the `generate_continuation_post` method in the `AIContentGenerator` to accept the `add_chichewa_humor` flag, allowing both features to be triggered in the same function call.
2.  **Fixed an `AttributeError`**: The initial test failed because I had forgotten to instantiate the `ChichewaIntegrator` in the `AIContentGenerator`'s constructor. I quickly resolved this by adding `self.chichewa_integrator = ChichewaIntegrator()` to the `__init__` method.
3.  **Created a Combined Test Script**: I wrote `scripts/test_week2_features_combined.py`. This script simulates a user wanting to continue a post while also adding personality. It calls `generate_continuation_post` with `add_chichewa_humor=True`.
4.  **Executed and Validated**: I ran the script and carefully reviewed the output.

## The Results
The integration test was a complete success. The final output was a high-quality continuation of the original post that also included the Chichewa greeting and closing phrases.

This confirms that the features are not only functional on their own but also compatible and capable of working together as intended. The system can now produce a humor-infused follow-up post in a single step, which is a powerful combination for creating engaging content series.

## Final Status for Week 2
All tasks for Week 2 are complete, implemented, and validated. The system is ready for the next phase of development.
