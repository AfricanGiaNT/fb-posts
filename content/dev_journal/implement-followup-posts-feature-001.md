# Implement Follow-up Posts Feature for Single Post Workflow

## What I Built
I successfully implemented the follow-up posts feature for the single post generation workflow, addressing the user's request to bring back the ability to generate follow-up posts and implement a 5-post history limit for AI context.

## The Problem
The single post generation workflow previously had the ability to generate follow-up posts, but this feature was removed. The user wanted:
1. The ability to generate follow-up posts after approving a single post
2. AI to have access to history of generated and approved posts
3. A limit of 5 posts for context that resets after session ends

## My Solution
I implemented a comprehensive follow-up post generation system that integrates seamlessly with the existing single post workflow:

### Enhanced Post Approval Workflow
- **Modified `_approve_post` method** to add approved posts to the session using existing `_add_post_to_series` infrastructure
- **Added interactive options** after post approval: Generate Follow-up, View Series, Export, or Done
- **Integrated with existing multi-post infrastructure** to leverage relationship types and context awareness

### Follow-up Post Generation System
- **Relationship Type Selection**: Users can choose from 6 relationship types (Different Aspects, Series Continuation, Technical Deep Dive, etc.)
- **AI Auto-Selection**: Option to let AI choose the best relationship type
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Follow-up posts are generated with full awareness of previous posts in the series
- **Parent Post Linking**: Each follow-up post is properly linked to its parent post

### 5-Post History Limit
- **Updated `_update_session_context` method** to limit context to the last 5 posts
- **Performance optimization** by focusing on recent posts rather than entire series
- **Contextual information** shows "5/8 posts" format to indicate limited context from larger series

### User Interface Enhancements
- **Interactive post approval screen** with clear options for next steps
- **Series management** with ability to view, export, and manage post series
- **Relationship selection interface** with intuitive options
- **Export functionality** for individual posts or entire series

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components Added
1. **Follow-up Generation Methods**:
   - `_handle_followup_generation()` - Initiates follow-up post creation
   - `_show_followup_relationship_selection()` - Shows relationship type options
   - `_handle_followup_relationship_selection()` - Processes relationship selection and generates post

2. **Series Management Methods**:
   - `_view_series()` - Shows series overview with all posts
   - `_export_current_post()` - Exports individual post content
   - `_export_series()` - Exports entire series

3. **Enhanced Session Management**:
   - Updated `_update_session_context()` with 5-post limit
   - Added callback handlers for new actions
   - Integrated with existing multi-post infrastructure

### Integration Points
- **Leverages existing relationship types** from `AIContentGenerator`
- **Uses existing context-aware generation** methods
- **Maintains backward compatibility** with single post workflow
- **Preserves all existing functionality** while adding new features

## The Results
- **Seamless user experience**: After approving a post, users get clear options for next steps
- **Intelligent follow-up generation**: AI generates contextually relevant follow-up posts
- **Performance optimization**: 5-post limit prevents context bloat while maintaining relevance
- **Full series management**: Users can view, export, and manage their post series
- **Relationship variety**: 6 different relationship types plus AI auto-selection

## Key Benefits
1. **Enhanced productivity**: Users can create post series from single markdown files
2. **Context awareness**: AI maintains understanding of previous posts for better follow-ups
3. **Performance optimized**: 5-post limit ensures fast generation without losing context
4. **User control**: Clear options for relationship types and series management
5. **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

## Testing Implementation
Created comprehensive test script (`test_followup_feature.py`) that validates:
- Relationship types are available and functioning
- Initial post generation works correctly
- Follow-up posts generate with different relationship types
- 5-post context limitation works as expected
- Session context is properly formatted and limited

This implementation successfully restores the follow-up post generation feature while adding the requested 5-post history limit, providing users with a powerful tool for creating engaging post series from their development work.
