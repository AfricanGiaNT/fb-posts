## What I Built
I implemented and validated the "Content Continuation" feature, completing the Day 3-4 tasks for Week 2 of the Phase 4 plan. This feature allows users to generate natural follow-up posts from existing content, making it easy to create a content series.

## The Workflow
1.  **`/continue` Command**: A new `/continue` command was added to the Telegram bot. When used, the bot prompts the user to paste the text of the post they wish to continue.
2.  **State Management**: The bot enters an `awaiting_continuation_input` state to correctly handle the user's next message as the source text.
3.  **AI-Powered Generation**: The core of the feature is a new `generate_continuation_post` method in the `AIContentGenerator`. This method uses a specialized prompt that instructs the AI to analyze the previous post and write a new one that builds upon it, adds new value, and uses natural transition phrases.
4.  **Display and Feedback**: The newly generated post is then displayed to the user with the standard "Approve/Regenerate" options, allowing them to continue their workflow seamlessly.

## The Validation Process
Since I couldn't test the Telegram command flow directly, I created a dedicated script, `scripts/test_continuation_feature.py`, to test the core AI logic. The script fed a sample post to the `generate_continuation_post` method.

## The Results
The test was highly successful. The AI generated a high-quality follow-up post that:
-   Used a natural transition ("Following up on my last post...").
-   Introduced a new, relevant topic (CRM integration) that logically followed the original post.
-   Maintained the tone and style of the source text.
-   Clearly articulated new benefits and metrics.

## Key Innovation
The strength of this feature lies in its specialized prompt, which guides the AI to act as a "series writer" rather than just a single-post generator. This provides significant value by simplifying the creation of cohesive, multi-part content, a key goal of the overall project.
