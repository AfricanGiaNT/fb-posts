## What I Built
I successfully implemented the "Chichewa Humor Integration" feature as part of Week 2 of the Phase 4 plan. This feature injects personality into the generated content by adding Chichewa phrases with contextual English translations.

## The Process
1.  **Created `ChichewaIntegrator` Class**: I developed a new, separate class (`scripts/chichewa_integrator.py`) to handle the logic for phrase selection and integration. This keeps the concerns separate from the main AI generator.
2.  **Integrated with `AIContentGenerator`**: I modified the main generator to include an `add_chichewa_humor` flag. When this flag is set to `True`, it calls the `ChichewaIntegrator` to wrap the generated post with a greeting and a closing.
3.  **Added Contextual Translations**: A key part of the implementation was including parenthetical English translations (e.g., "Muli bwanji (How are you?)") to ensure the content remains accessible to a non-Chichewa-speaking audience while still adding cultural flavor.
4.  **Created a Test Script**: I wrote `scripts/test_chichewa_integration.py` to validate the feature. The script generates two posts—one with humor and one without—and prints them for a side-by-side comparison.

## The Results
The test confirmed the feature works perfectly. The post with humor enabled included the Chichewa greeting and closing, while the standard post remained unchanged. The "subtle" intensity level is effective, adding a warm, personal touch without disrupting the core message.

## Key Innovation
The implementation is clean and extensible. By creating a dedicated class for the integration, we can easily expand it in the future to support different intensity levels (e.g., a "prominent" mode that injects phrases into the body of the text) without refactoring the main content generator.
