## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### **Week 1: Audience-Aware Content**

#### **Day 1-2: Audience Selection System**
```python
# Simple audience types
AUDIENCE_TYPES = {
    'business': 'Business Owner/General',
    'technical': 'Developer/Technical'
}

# Add to telegram bot
async def _show_audience_selection(self, update, context):
    keyboard = [
        [InlineKeyboardButton("üè¢ Business Owner", callback_data="audience_business")],
        [InlineKeyboardButton("üíª Technical", callback_data="audience_technical")]
    ]
    reply_markup = InlineKeyboardMarkup(keyboard)
    await update.message.reply_text(
        "Who's your target audience?",
        reply_markup=reply_markup
    )
```

#### **Day 3-4: Content Adaptation Prompts**
```python
BUSINESS_AUDIENCE_PROMPT = """
AUDIENCE: Business Owner/General (like busy shop owners, service providers)

Content Guidelines:
- Use simple, clear language
- Focus on business impact: time saved, money made, problems solved
- Use relatable examples (running a shop, managing customers, handling inventory)
- Avoid technical jargon - explain in everyday terms
- Emphasize practical benefits and real-world results
- Make it sound like you're talking to a friend who owns a business

Examples of good language:
- "This saves me 3 hours every week"
- "My customers are happier because..."
- "I used to spend all day on paperwork, now..."
- "It's like having an assistant that never sleeps"
"""
```

#### **Day 5: Testing & Refinement**
- Test with existing markdown content
- Generate posts for both audience types
- Refine language adaptation based on results

### **Week 2: Chichewa Integration & Content Continuation**

#### **Day 1-2: Chichewa Phrase System**
```python
class ChichewaIntegrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phrases = {
            'greeting': ['Muli bwanji', 'Zikomo'],
            'excitement': ['Koma zabwino', 'Zachisangalalo'],
            'success': ['Zachitika', 'Zabwino kwambiri'],
            'closing': ['Tiwonana', 'Zikomo kwambiri']
        }
    
    def integrate_phrases(self, content: str, intensity: str = 'subtle'):
        """Add appropriate Chichewa phrases to content"""
        # Start with subtle integration
        # Add context explanations for non-Chichewa speakers
        pass
```

#### **Day 3-4: Content Continuation Feature**
```python
async def _continue_command(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Handle /continue command"""
    await update.message.reply_text(
        "üìù **Content Continuation**\n\n"
        "Paste your existing post text, and I'll generate a natural follow-up!\n\n"
        "Just paste the text in your next message."
    )
    # Set user state to expect post text
    context.user_data['waiting_for_continuation_input'] = True
```

#### **Day 5: Integration & Testing**
- Test all features together
- Refine Chichewa integration based on results
- Document usage patterns

## üîÑ Alternative Approaches Considered

### **Audience Adaptation**:
- **Chosen**: AI prompt modification for different audiences
- **Alternative**: Separate AI models (more complex, unnecessary)

### **Chichewa Integration**:
- **Chosen**: Natural phrase integration with context
- **Alternative**: Full translation (too complex for humor purpose)

### **Content Continuation**:
- **Chosen**: Simple text input via `/continue` command
- **Alternative**: URL parsing from social media (more complex)
