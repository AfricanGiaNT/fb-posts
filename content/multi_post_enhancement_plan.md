    'series_id': 'uuid-12345',
    'original_markdown': markdown_content,
    'filename': 'project_log_v001.md',
    'posts': [
        {
            'post_id': 1,
            'content': 'post content...',
            'tone_used': 'Behind-the-Build',
            'airtable_record_id': 'rec123',
            'approved': True,
            'parent_post_id': None,
            'relationship_type': None
        }
    ],
    'current_draft': {...},
    'session_context': 'AI context summary...'
}
```

### **New Airtable Fields**
- [ ] `Post Series ID` (Text/UUID)
