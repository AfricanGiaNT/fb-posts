# **🧠 Story-Driven Content Rule for AI Bots & Websites**

Use this rule to generate story-driven, persuasive content from scratch for your AI automation tools or websites. It combines neuroscience-backed storytelling, emotional copywriting, and proven marketing frameworks to speak directly to entrepreneurs looking to automate their businesses.

---

## **✅ Storytelling Copywriting Checklist**

- **🔬 Brain Chemicals**
    
    Engage the brain through:
    
    - **Dopamine** → reward, motivation
    - **Cortisol** → attention, urgency
    - **Oxytocin** → empathy, connection
- **🦸 Audience as Hero**
    
    Your product is NOT the hero — your *audience* is. Frame them as the main character, your AI tool as the wise guide.
    
- **🎯 Specific & Sensory Language**
    
    Use **visual**, **kinesthetic**, and **auditory** language:
    
    - Visual: *“Picture this…”*
    - Kinesthetic: *“It felt like a weight lifted…”*
    - Auditory: *“You hear your phone buzz with a client’s thank-you…”*
- **❤️ Emotion & Identity**
    
    Tap into their identity and emotional desires. Highlight outcomes that improve how they see themselves (*“in-control CEO”*).
    
- **🔁 Story Framework: Roadblock → Solution → Product**
    1. **Roadblock**: Define the struggle
    2. **Solution**: Show the emotional journey
    3. **Product**: Reveal your AI tool as the bridge to transformation
