‚ú® Style Guide: AI Facebook Content Generator

üíª Coding Standards

Languages & Tools
	‚Ä¢	Primary Language: Python for scripts, JavaScript for Telegram or front-end interactions
	‚Ä¢	AI Interaction: Use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o API or Cursor AI internal agents

Naming Conventions
	‚Ä¢	Variables (Python): lower_case_with_underscores
	‚Ä¢	Functions (Python): snake_case (e.g., generate_draft())
	‚Ä¢	JS Functions (if needed): camelCase
	‚Ä¢	Files: lowercase_with_underscores.py or .md
	‚Ä¢	Draft Naming: Based on post title (e.g., telegram_bot_announcement.md)

Code Formatting
	‚Ä¢	2-space indentation
	‚Ä¢	Function definitions must include docstrings

def generate_draft(markdown_input):
    """Generate a Facebook post draft from markdown input."""


	‚Ä¢	Avoid magic values ‚Äî use constants (e.g., DEFAULT_TONE = "Behind-the-Build")

‚∏ª

üìÑ Documentation & Prompt Structure

Markdown Files
	‚Ä¢	Use .md or .mdc for all human-readable files and rules
	‚Ä¢	Store in /rules/, /docs/, and /content/

Required Files

File	Purpose
instructions.md	How to use the system
tone_guidelines.mdc	Defines personal brand tones
ai_prompt_structure.mdc	Master prompt format for AI
persona_phrases.mdc	Branded, recurring phrases and style cues

Comments & Inline Examples
	‚Ä¢	Include example output directly in AI rules

## Example Output (Tone 2: What Broke)
I broke something I built. And I loved it.



‚∏ª

ü§ñ Instructions for AI Output Style

AI Formatting Rules
	‚Ä¢	Use short paragraphs (2‚Äì3 lines)
	‚Ä¢	Add line breaks between logical sections
	‚Ä¢	Insert relevant emojis naturally (not overloaded)
	‚Ä¢	Maintain a casual, reflective tone
	‚Ä¢	Include hooks and end with insights, reflections, or soft CTAs

Output Must:
	‚Ä¢	Start with a relatable hook
(e.g., ‚ÄúI broke something I built. And I loved it.‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Match one of the 5 defined tones
	‚Ä¢	Avoid robotic/formal phrasing (e.g., ‚ÄúThis system is very efficient.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ùå)
	‚Ä¢	Include personal context or emotion

‚∏ª

‚úçÔ∏è AI Style Suggestions

If AI deviates from tone or formatting:
	‚Ä¢	Suggest rephrasing for more personality
	‚Ä¢	Recommend better hook or ending CTA
	‚Ä¢	Flag overuse or absence of emojis
	‚Ä¢	Recommend tone switch (e.g., from dry ‚Üí ‚ÄúBehind-the-Build‚Äù)
