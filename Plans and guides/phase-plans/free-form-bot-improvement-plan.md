# Free-Form Bot Improvement Plan

## What I Built
A comprehensive plan to add free-form input capabilities to my Telegram bot, allowing me to provide custom instructions or edits at any stage: file upload, post editing, and follow-up generation. This will let me type exactly what I want, making the bot more flexible and user-centric.

## The Problem
The current bot workflow is rigid: While generating a post with the markdown file, i can not even add any text with it informing the bot what i am looking for; after generating a post from a markdown file, I can only approve or regenerate. If I like most of a post but want to tweak or expand certain parts, I have to discard the whole thing and start over. There's no way to add context or make targeted edits, which slows down my workflow and leads to frustration.

## My Proposed Solution
I have proposed a free-form feature that lets me:
- Add optional context or instructions when uploading a file (e.g., "expand on X", "focus on technical challenges").
- Edit generated posts by typing what I want changed (e.g., "add more details about deployment", "restructure to focus on business impact").
- Provide custom context for follow-up posts (e.g., "focus on lessons learned").
- Use pure text input (no buttons), with a 5-minute timeout for responses.
- Preview all edits before applying.
- Keep the original tone unless I explicitly request a change.

## How It Works: The Technical Details

### Session State Management
- New session states: `awaiting_file_context`, `awaiting_story_edits`, `awaiting_followup_context`, `awaiting_batch_context`.
- The `_handle_text` method routes input based on the current state.
- Free-form input is stored in the session and included in AI prompts.

### File Upload Context
- while uploading a file, the user can add context or instructions for the post generation. OR IF LEFT BLANK THEN After uploading a file, the bot asks:  
  "Would you like to provide any context or specific instructions for this post? (Type your instructions or 'skip' to continue)"
- If I provide input, it's used to enhance the AI's prompt for post generation, IF NOT then the bot will generate the post with the default instructions.

### Story Editing
- After a post is generated, I can select "Edit Post" and type my changes.
- The bot parses my instructions and regenerates the post, showing a before/after preview(if i want to see the changes).
- Supports both full post and section-specific edits.

### Follow-up Enhancement
- Before generating a follow-up, the bot asks for custom context, if left blank then the bot will generate the follow-up with the default instructions.
- My input is combined with the relationship type for a more targeted follow-up.

### Batch Processing
- Free-form context can be applied to all posts in a batch.
- Each post can still be customized individually.

### Error Handling
- If input is too long: "Your input is too long. Please keep it under 500 characters."
- If input is unclear: "I'll do my best to interpret your request. Here's what I understood: [interpretation]" -> then waits for confirmation from the user to continue with the generation.
- If no input in 5 minutes: "No input received. Continuing with default generation."

# Technical Implementation Details

## Key Methods to Add/Modify

### 1. Enhanced Text Handler
```python
async def _handle_text(self, update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    # Add routing for new free-form states
    if session.get('state') == 'awaiting_file_context':
        await self._handle_file_context_input(update, context, text)
    elif session.get('state') == 'awaiting_story_edits':
        await self._handle_story_edit_input(update, context, text)
    elif session.get('state') == 'awaiting_followup_context':
        await self._handle_followup_context_input(update, context, text)
    elif session.get('state') == 'awaiting_batch_context':
        await self._handle_batch_context_input(update, context, text)
    # ... existing logic
```

### 2. New Free-Form Handlers
```python
async def _handle_file_context_input(self, update, context, text)
async def _handle_story_edit_input(self, update, context, text)
async def _handle_followup_context_input(self, update, context, text)
async def _handle_batch_context_input(self, update, context, text)
async def _preview_edits(self, query, session, edit_instructions)
```

### 3. Enhanced AI Integration
```python
def _build_context_aware_prompt_with_freeform(self, markdown_content, freeform_context, ...)
def _parse_edit_instructions(self, edit_text)
def _apply_edits_to_post(self, original_post, edit_instructions)
def _validate_freeform_input(self, text)
```

### 4. Timeout Management
```python
async def _start_freeform_timeout(self, user_id, state)
async def _handle_freeform_timeout(self, user_id)
def _check_freeform_timeout(self, session)
```

# User Experience Flow

## File Upload with Context
1. User uploads .md file with context or instructions. if left blank then step 2 triggers.
2. Bot: "Would you like to provide any context or specific instructions for this post? (Type your instructions or 'skip' to continue)"
3. User types: "expand on the technical challenges and include more code examples" etc
4. Bot generates post with enhanced technical focus
5. Continue with normal flow (tone selection, approval, etc.)

## Story Editing
1. User sees generated post
2. User clicks "Edit Post"
3. Bot: "What would you like to change? (e.g., 'expand on the technical challenges', 'restructure to focus on business impact')"
4. User types: "add more details about the deployment process"
5. Bot shows preview of changes
6. User approves or requests further edits

## Follow-up Enhancement
1. User clicks "Generate Follow-up"
2. Bot: "Any specific context for this follow-up? (e.g., 'focus on lessons learned', 'emphasize the next steps')"
3. User types: "focus on the lessons learned and what I'd do differently"
4. Bot generates follow-up with that focus

# Error Handling Strategy

## Input Validation
- **Input too long**: "Your input is too long. Please keep it under 500 characters."
- **Input too short**: "Please provide more specific instructions."
- **Invalid format**: "Please provide clear instructions. Examples: 'expand on X', 'focus on Y', 'add more details about Z'"

## Timeout Handling
- **No input received**: "No input received. Continuing with default generation."
- **Session timeout**: "Session timed out. Please start a new session."

## AI Processing Errors
- **Unclear input**: "I'll do my best to interpret your request. Here's what I understood: [interpretation]"
- **Processing failure**: "I couldn't process your request. Please try again with different wording."
